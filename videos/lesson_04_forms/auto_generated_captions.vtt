1
00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:00.965
Let's be real.

2
00:00:01.185 --> 00:00:02.885
We have all been there.

3
00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:04.685
You're filling out some form online

4
00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:06.845
and suddenly it just breaks

5
00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:09.365
and it's more than just a little annoying, right?

6
00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:12.325
It's usually a sign of a really poorly designed system.

7
00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:14.765
So in this explainer, we're gonna break down how

8
00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:17.605
to build way better forms that actually work for everyone.

9
00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:20.615
Think about it. You find the perfect thing online,

10
00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.575
you're excited, you're ready to buy.

11
00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:25.975
You head to the checkout, and then you run into the form.

12
00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:28.055
You start typing, something goes wrong

13
00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:29.335
and you just, you give up.

14
00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:31.455
We've all done it. It is so frustrating,

15
00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:33.775
and it usually starts with a useless little message like

16
00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:35.165
this error.

17
00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:38.325
That's it. Just error. What does that even mean?

18
00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:40.485
What did I do wrong? How do I fix it?

19
00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:45.085
Or what about this classic invalid? Invalid what?

20
00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:48.165
My name isn't invalid. My email address is perfectly valid.

21
00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.395
Thank you very much. And oh, my personal favorite,

22
00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:52.955
something went wrong.

23
00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:55.435
You think this kind of vague,

24
00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:58.915
completely unhelpful feedback isn't just a minor thing.

25
00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.635
It is a symptom of a much, much bigger problem.

26
00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:06.395
And this is the crucial point right here.

27
00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:10.355
A bad form isn't just inconvenient, it's a dead end.

28
00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.955
It literally stops people from signing up, from buying,

29
00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:15.115
from connecting with you.

30
00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.515
It completely blocks them from using

31
00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:18.555
your product or service.

32
00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:21.665
A poorly designed form, well,

33
00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:25.145
it basically acts like an invisible wall for a lot of us.

34
00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:26.785
It's just really frustrating.

35
00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:30.065
But you know, for someone using assistive technology like a

36
00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:32.785
screen reader or maybe someone with a cognitive disability,

37
00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:36.025
that wall can be totally impossible to get past.

38
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.865
Let's look at one of the most common bricks in that wall.

39
00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:41.575
Okay? You see this all the time.

40
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:43.575
This is a perfect example of

41
00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:45.495
what we call the placeholder problem.

42
00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:48.535
See how the field has that faint text inside it

43
00:01:48.535 --> 00:01:51.455
that says first name, you click on it, you start to type

44
00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:53.495
and poof, the label is gone.

45
00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:56.015
Now what if you get distracted for a second?

46
00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.015
You look back at the screen, what was this field for?

47
00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:01.255
Again, this is exactly why.

48
00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:02.775
Using that placeholder text

49
00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:05.455
as your only label is such a terrible practice.

50
00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:08.095
It vanishes, which means you lose all context.

51
00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:11.455
This forces your brain to work harder trying to remember

52
00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:12.895
what you were supposed to type there,

53
00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:15.655
and it makes it almost impossible to quickly scan

54
00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:17.655
and double check your work before you hit submit.

55
00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:20.135
They just aren't real persistent labels.

56
00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:24.055
So how do we tear down this invisible wall?

57
00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:26.455
Well, the good news is it's not nearly

58
00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:27.935
as complicated as it sounds.

59
00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:31.935
There are really three fundamental keys to unlocking forms

60
00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:34.975
that are accessible and just way more user friendly.

61
00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:36.735
And here they are.

62
00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:40.175
It all comes down to persistent labels, helpful errors,

63
00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:41.575
and smart auto complete.

64
00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:43.855
Seriously. If you get these three things right,

65
00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:45.975
you are well on your way to creating a form

66
00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:47.615
that actually works for everyone.

67
00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:52.575
So let's break 'em down one by one. Okay, first up, labels.

68
00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:55.055
The best way to think about a label is like

69
00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:56.375
a permanent guidepost.

70
00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:58.775
It should always, always be

71
00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:01.445
There telling the user exactly what information they need

72
00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:03.685
to put in that specific field no matter what.

73
00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:05.815
So what makes a label great?

74
00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:09.135
Well, it's always visible and never disappears,

75
00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:12.655
and it's programmatically associated with its input.

76
00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:15.535
Now that sounds super technical, but it's really simple.

77
00:03:16.075 --> 00:03:18.175
It just means the code connects the label

78
00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:19.535
text to the input box.

79
00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:23.615
That way a screen reader can announce email, text input.

80
00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.095
That connection is invisible to most of us,

81
00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:28.535
but it is absolutely critical for accessibility.

82
00:03:28.965 --> 00:03:31.055
Alright, next up errors.

83
00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:34.295
We have got to stop thinking of error messages as a way

84
00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:35.775
to shout you failed

85
00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:39.055
and start thinking of them as a helpful hint to say,

86
00:03:39.315 --> 00:03:40.615
Hey, here's how to succeed.

87
00:03:41.195 --> 00:03:44.695
And this slide just shows the difference so perfectly.

88
00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:47.495
On the left, you get invalid email,

89
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:49.095
which is totally useless,

90
00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:53.015
but look at the right email must include at and a domain.

91
00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:56.735
Ah, okay, now I know exactly what I need to do to fix it.

92
00:03:57.115 --> 00:03:59.775
See, one is a wall, the other is a signpost.

93
00:04:00.795 --> 00:04:03.355
A truly great error message does three simple things.

94
00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:05.995
One, it clearly identifies what went wrong.

95
00:04:06.295 --> 00:04:07.995
Two, it suggests how to fix it.

96
00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:10.715
And three, it uses a clear visual cue,

97
00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:13.515
like an icon in some text, not just a red border

98
00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:15.835
that someone who's colorblind might not even be able to see.

99
00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.535
Our third and final key is auto complete.

100
00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:21.615
Now, this is the smart assistant

101
00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:23.335
that makes filling out forms faster

102
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:24.935
and easier for all of us,

103
00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:27.535
but it's especially vital for users with motor

104
00:04:27.595 --> 00:04:28.895
or cognitive disabilities.

105
00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:31.365
You know that magical moment, right?

106
00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:33.965
When you click on the first line of an address field

107
00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:35.685
and your browser just pops up

108
00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:37.565
and offers to fill in the entire thing for you?

109
00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:40.485
That's not magic. That's just really good design.

110
00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:44.085
So how does that work? Well, behind the scenes, a designer

111
00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:46.045
or developer adds a simple little tag,

112
00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:48.405
something like auto complete equals street address.

113
00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:51.365
This tag tells the browser exactly what kind

114
00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:52.845
of information the field is expecting,

115
00:04:53.145 --> 00:04:54.165
and that allows the browser

116
00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:56.325
or even a password manager to give you

117
00:04:56.325 --> 00:04:58.565
that helpful time saving autofill suggestion.

118
00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:01.085
And here is the real takeaway.

119
00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:04.125
Deciding which fields get an auto complete tag isn't

120
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.165
just some engineering task.

121
00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:07.525
It is a crucial design decision.

122
00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:09.485
It's about you, the creator,

123
00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:11.965
intentionally designing a lower effort,

124
00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:13.845
more accessible experience for your users.

125
00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:17.365
So when you put all three of these keys together,

126
00:05:17.655 --> 00:05:19.605
persistent labels, helpful errors,

127
00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:20.845
and smart auto complete,

128
00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:23.085
you stop building those invisible walls

129
00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:26.845
and instead you start designing inclusive digital doorways.

130
00:05:27.905 --> 00:05:31.265
Ultimately, that's what this is all about, inclusive design.

131
00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:32.865
It's not some niche topic.

132
00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.545
It's the core practice

133
00:05:34.545 --> 00:05:36.665
of making sure the digital world is open

134
00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:39.105
and usable for every single person, no matter

135
00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:41.065
what their physical or cognitive abilities are.

136
00:05:41.685 --> 00:05:42.945
So I'll leave you with this question.

137
00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:44.905
The next time you design or build

138
00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:47.465
or even just fill out a form, ask yourself,

139
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:49.905
is this thing a barrier that's shedding people out

140
00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:51.865
or is it a welcome mat inviting them in?

141
00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:52.945
Thanks for joining us.

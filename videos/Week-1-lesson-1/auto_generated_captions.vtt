00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:02.405
There's a huge part of the internet that's all

2
00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:04.725
around us affecting everything we do online,

3
00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:06.965
but for millions and millions of people,

4
00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:08.285
it's basically invisible.

5
00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:11.765
I'm talking about hidden barriers, the ones that decide

6
00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:14.005
who gets to fully participate in our digital world

7
00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:15.365
and who gets left out.

8
00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:17.325
So today, let's pull back the curtain.

9
00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:22.385
Let's start with a number, 94.8%.

10
00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.705
Just look at that for a second. That's a huge number.

11
00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:27.745
You think it has to be something good, right?

12
00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.665
So what do you think that could be?

13
00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:32.385
I mean, in the world of tech, a number that high,

14
00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:36.145
maybe it's user satisfaction, market share for some new app.

15
00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:40.765
Well, the reality is a lot more serious. That's right.

16
00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:44.125
A massive study found that nearly 95% of the web's,

17
00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:46.965
most popular sites have basic accessibility failures.

18
00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.085
These are flaws that create major

19
00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:50.685
roadblocks for people with disabilities.

20
00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:54.125
So this isn't some tiny niche problem, it's a systemic issue

21
00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.125
that's baked into the very fabric of the internet.

22
00:00:57.315 --> 00:01:00.205
Okay? So to really understand why that number is

23
00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:02.885
so shockingly high, we gotta back up a step.

24
00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:05.925
We have to know what we're aiming for in the first place.

25
00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:10.375
So what exactly is digital accessibility at its core?

26
00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:12.455
It's pretty simple. It's all about making sure

27
00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:16.015
that our digital world, our websites, our apps can be used

28
00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:17.975
by people with all kinds of disabilities.

29
00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:20.455
The whole goal is to build things in a way

30
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.255
that those barriers just don't exist from the start.

31
00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:25.775
Now, this might sound really complex,

32
00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:28.335
but honestly, the entire philosophy

33
00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:31.055
of accessibility rests on two foundational ideas.

34
00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:34.735
If you can get your head around these two simple principles,

35
00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:36.215
you'll understand the whole thing.

36
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:40.095
So principle one is all about embracing human diversity.

37
00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:42.695
We just can't assume that our user can see

38
00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.135
or that they can hear, or that they can use a mouse.

39
00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:46.975
The design has to be flexible

40
00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:49.215
and work for a whole spectrum of human abilities.

41
00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:52.605
And the second principle is all about technology.

42
00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:55.365
You see, many people with disabilities use special

43
00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:56.525
tools to get around the web.

44
00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:58.765
Things like screen readers that read text out loud

45
00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:00.285
or voice control software.

46
00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:03.885
A website has to be built to play nice with these tools, not

47
00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:05.125
to put up a wall and block them.

48
00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:08.395
Alright, so those are the two core ideas.

49
00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:10.115
Now let's take a look at

50
00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:12.235
what happens in the real world when these

51
00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:13.275
principles get ignored.

52
00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:15.515
Let's see some of these barriers in action.

53
00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:20.195
First up, let's talk about a super common mistake using

54
00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:22.995
color as the only way to give someone information.

55
00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:24.975
Okay, picture this,

56
00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:27.255
you're filling out a form online and you make a mistake.

57
00:02:27.475 --> 00:02:29.855
The little box turns red, simple enough,

58
00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.255
but what if you're colorblind for you?

59
00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.895
That red box might look exactly the same as all the others,

60
00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:37.975
and just like that, you have no idea where the air is.

61
00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:39.735
The information is totally lost,

62
00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:44.145
and boom, that is a classic violation of principle one.

63
00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:45.865
The design is completely dependent

64
00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.025
on a single human ability.

65
00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:49.185
In this case, the ability to see

66
00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:50.905
and distinguish specific colors.

67
00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:54.755
Alright? Another huge one you'll find absolutely everywhere

68
00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:57.835
is images or icons that are missing a text description.

69
00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:00.945
Think about an icon, maybe a little cloud

70
00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:02.785
that tells you your file has been saved.

71
00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:04.825
If you can see it, it's obvious.

72
00:03:05.245 --> 00:03:06.945
But for someone using a screen reader,

73
00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:10.025
if there's no text alternative coded in, well,

74
00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:11.905
the screen reader has nothing to announce.

75
00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:13.785
The icon and its entire meaning

76
00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:15.065
are just completely invisible.

77
00:03:15.685 --> 00:03:18.305
And here's what's so important about this example.

78
00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:21.265
One little mistake can break both of our rules.

79
00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:24.425
It relies only on site, which violates principle one,

80
00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:26.305
and it actively blocks the screen reader,

81
00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:27.665
which violates principle two.

82
00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:31.255
Okay, for our last example, let's

83
00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:33.495
Talk about how we physically Interact with a website.

84
00:03:34.365 --> 00:03:35.575
Have you ever tried to get

85
00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:38.815
around a website using only the tab key on your keyboard?

86
00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:41.495
For many people, that's their main way of navigating,

87
00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:43.255
but some sites have links

88
00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:45.255
or buttons that are just impossible

89
00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:46.335
to get to without a mouse.

90
00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:49.735
If you can't use a mouse for whatever reason, those parts

91
00:03:49.735 --> 00:03:51.615
of the site are completely off limits to you.

92
00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:55.915
And here we go again. We see both principles being broken.

93
00:03:56.495 --> 00:03:59.235
The design makes a huge assumption about the physical

94
00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:00.435
ability to use a mouse.

95
00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:03.515
And in doing so, it blocks keyboard navigation

96
00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:06.715
and other technologies like voice control that rely on

97
00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:08.155
that same fundamental structure.

98
00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.595
Now, these examples might seem like

99
00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:11.875
small technical glitches,

100
00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:14.235
But when you multiply them across millions

101
00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:16.835
Of websites, the impact is absolutely enormous.

102
00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.875
And that's really why this matters so much.

103
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:21.695
Remember that shocking number from the beginning?

104
00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:24.175
It's not from one single giant problem.

105
00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.015
It's the result of millions

106
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:28.495
of these seemingly small barriers relying on color

107
00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:30.935
for getting text descriptions, forcing mouse use,

108
00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:34.655
all adding up to a web that is overwhelmingly inaccessible.

109
00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:37.175
And if we actually look at the data,

110
00:04:37.515 --> 00:04:41.415
we can see the biggest culprits low contrast text is the

111
00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:44.895
number one issue that's on almost 80% of pages,

112
00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:47.535
making them hard to read and look what's right behind it.

113
00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:49.735
Missing alternative text for images.

114
00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:53.535
The exact problem we just talked about on more than half

115
00:04:53.535 --> 00:04:54.535
of all homepages,

116
00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:58.135
the list just goes on showing the same fundamental mistakes

117
00:04:58.445 --> 00:04:59.975
over and over again.

118
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.775
But you know, this isn't just a technical issue about

119
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:04.495
code, it's a human issue.

120
00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:06.695
And this quote really puts it all into perspective.

121
00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:10.015
When the largest minority group in the entire world is

122
00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:12.175
systemically excluded from the most important tool

123
00:05:12.175 --> 00:05:15.495
of modern life, well that's a massive problem of equity.

124
00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:17.215
And that really leaves all of us

125
00:05:17.215 --> 00:05:18.935
with a critical question to think about.

126
00:05:19.665 --> 00:05:21.895
We're all architects of this digital world,

127
00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:24.535
whether we build websites, create content, or just use them.

128
00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:27.855
So we have to ask ourselves, are we building open public

129
00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:29.095
squares for everyone?

130
00:05:29.475 --> 00:05:32.375
Or are we building walled gardens with gates that only some

131
00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:32.975
of us can open.

            <div class="captions">There's a huge part of the internet that's all around us affecting everything we do online, but for millions and millions of people, it's basically invisible. I'm talking about hidden barriers, the ones that decide who gets to fully participate in our digital world and who gets left out. So today, let's pull back the curtain. Let's start with a number, 94.8%.</div>

            <div class="captions">Just look at that for a second. That's a huge number. You think it has to be something good, right? So what do you think that could be?</div>

            <div class="captions">I mean, in the world of tech, a number that high, maybe it's user satisfaction, market share for some new app. Well, the reality is a lot more serious. That's right.</div>

            <div class="captions">A massive study found that nearly 95% of the web's, most popular sites have basic accessibility failures. These are flaws that create major roadblocks for people with disabilities. So this isn't some tiny niche problem, it's a systemic issue that's baked into the very fabric of the internet.</div>

            <div class="captions">Okay? So to really understand why that number is so shockingly high, we gotta back up a step. We have to know what we're aiming for in the first place. So what exactly is digital accessibility at its core?</div>

            <div class="captions">It's pretty simple. It's all about making sure that our digital world, our websites, our apps can be used by people with all kinds of disabilities. The whole goal is to build things in a way that those barriers just don't exist from the start. Now, this might sound really complex,</div>

            <img src="assets/frames/frame_0083.jpg" alt="Scene at 0:01:23">
            <div class="captions">but honestly, the entire philosophy of accessibility rests on two foundational ideas. If you can get your head around these two simple principles, you'll understand the whole thing. So principle one is all about embracing human diversity.</div>

            <div class="captions">We just can't assume that our user can see or that they can hear, or that they can use a mouse. The design has to be flexible and work for a whole spectrum of human abilities. And the second principle is all about technology.</div>

            <div class="captions">You see, many people with disabilities use special tools to get around the web. Things like screen readers that read text out loud or voice control software. A website has to be built to play nice with these tools, not to put up a wall and block them. Alright, so those are the two core ideas.</div>

            <div class="captions">Now let's take a look at what happens in the real world when these principles get ignored. Let's see some of these barriers in action. First up, let's talk about a super common mistake using</div>

            <div class="captions">you're filling out a form online and you make a mistake. The little box turns red, simple enough, but what if you're colorblind for you? That red box might look exactly the same as all the others, and just like that, you have no idea where the air is. The information is totally lost, and boom, that is a classic violation of principle one.</div>

            <div class="captions">The design is completely dependent on a single human ability. In this case, the ability to see and distinguish specific colors. Alright? Another huge one you'll find absolutely everywhere</div>

            <div class="captions">that tells you your file has been saved. If you can see it, it's obvious. But for someone using a screen reader, if there's no text alternative coded in, well, the screen reader has nothing to announce. The icon and its entire meaning are just completely invisible. And here's what's so important about this example.</div>

            <div class="captions">One little mistake can break both of our rules. It relies only on site, which violates principle one, and it actively blocks the screen reader, which violates principle two. Okay, for our last example, let's</div>

            <div class="captions">around a website using only the tab key on your keyboard? For many people, that's their main way of navigating, but some sites have links or buttons that are just impossible to get to without a mouse. If you can't use a mouse for whatever reason, those parts of the site are completely off limits to you. And here we go again. We see both principles being broken.</div>

            <div class="captions">The design makes a huge assumption about the physical ability to use a mouse. And in doing so, it blocks keyboard navigation and other technologies like voice control that rely on that same fundamental structure.</div>

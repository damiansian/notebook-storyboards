00:00:00.135 --> 00:00:01.585
Okay, so let's talk about something

2
00:00:01.585 --> 00:00:02.745
we see every single day.

3
00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.345
Color on our screens, the blues, the greens, the grays.

4
00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:07.945
They aren't just there to look pretty.

5
00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:10.185
They're fundamental language that helps us get

6
00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.825
around in our digital world, they guide our eyes,

7
00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:14.265
they signal what we can do.

8
00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:16.185
But what happens when that language

9
00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:17.505
isn't speaking to everyone?

10
00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.885
I mean, really think about that.

11
00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:21.885
What if the very colors that are supposed

12
00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:24.205
to help you actually hide critical information,

13
00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:27.085
what if they make it impossible to finish a simple task

14
00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:29.285
or even figure out what you're supposed to be looking at?

15
00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:31.745
Because for a huge part of the population,

16
00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:32.905
that's their reality.

17
00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:35.425
Poor color choices create these invisible

18
00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.785
walls every single day.

19
00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:38.345
So today we're

20
00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:40.585
Gonna break down how we can use color, not just to

21
00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.425
Be beautiful, but to be inclusive.

22
00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:45.755
Now, it's really easy to think of this stuff as you know,

23
00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.035
an edge case, something

24
00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:48.995
that only affects a tiny number of people.

25
00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:51.675
But the truth is it's way more common than you'd think.

26
00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:54.435
The web Content Accessibility Guidelines

27
00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:58.315
or WCAG, which is basically the global rule book for this,

28
00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:00.515
tells us that about 15%

29
00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:03.435
of working age adults have some kind of vision impairment.

30
00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:06.355
That's a huge number of people who might be struggling

31
00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:08.875
with designs that don't think about how color is perceived.

32
00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:10.595
So this isn't the niche problem at all.

33
00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:13.915
It's a mainstream design challenge. And here's

34
00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:16.515
The thing, it's not just about permanent conditions.

35
00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:18.355
We've all been there, right? Trying

36
00:01:18.355 --> 00:01:21.075
to read your phone screen in bright sunlight, squinting

37
00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:23.275
to see what's going on, or maybe you've

38
00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:25.475
Used a low power mode that Makes everything gray scale.

39
00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:28.155
In those moments, all of us are experiencing

40
00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.595
what you could call a situational

41
00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:31.275
Disability, where color and

42
00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:33.275
Contrast suddenly become absolutely

43
00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:34.995
critical. So designing for

44
00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:37.675
Accessibility, it really Is just designing for

45
00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:38.835
Everyone. So

46
00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:41.595
how do we actually start breaking down these barriers?

47
00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:44.715
Well, the first and most fundamental rule is just about

48
00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:46.995
making sure people can read the words on the screen,

49
00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:49.555
and it all boils down to one simple concept.

50
00:01:50.475 --> 00:01:52.295
Contrast. Simply put,

51
00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:55.095
Contrast is just the difference in brightness

52
00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:56.935
between two colors next to each other,

53
00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:58.775
like text and its background.

54
00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:01.695
The bigger that difference, the easier it is to read.

55
00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:04.335
You know, think black text on a white background,

56
00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:05.935
that's maximum contrast,

57
00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:09.095
but light gray text on a slightly lighter gray background.

58
00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:10.455
That's where things get messy.

59
00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:13.265
And Thankfully we don't have to guess.

60
00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:15.105
There are super clear guidelines for

61
00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:15.825
This. For

62
00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:18.585
Normalized text, the standard is a contrast ratio

63
00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.345
of at least 4.5 to one.

64
00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:21.985
Now, if the text is bigger,

65
00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:25.225
that requirement relaxes a bit down to three to one, just

66
00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:27.145
because larger text is naturally easier to see.

67
00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:29.465
These numbers are Pretty much our go-to

68
00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:30.825
benchmarks for readability.

69
00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:33.705
Just put yourself in this scenario for a second.

70
00:02:33.975 --> 00:02:34.985
Imagine you're trying

71
00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:37.065
to submit a really important form online,

72
00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:40.505
and the final confirm button has text that's so faint.

73
00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:42.065
You're not even sure what it says.

74
00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:45.785
That feeling of frustration, of uncertainty, that is exactly

75
00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:47.945
what poor text contrast creates,

76
00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:50.505
and it's a barrier that's so easy to avoid.

77
00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:52.665
Okay, so that same idea

78
00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:55.225
of contrast leads us right into our second rule.

79
00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:58.225
Once we can actually read the text, we need to be able

80
00:02:58.225 --> 00:03:00.685
to see the interactive parts of a page, you know,

81
00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:03.485
the buttons, the icons, the little input fields.

82
00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:06.125
These are the controls that let us actually do things.

83
00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.415
And just like with text, there's a clear benchmark here

84
00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:11.095
for user interface components

85
00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:14.055
and other graphics like say the border around a text box

86
00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:15.295
or an important icon.

87
00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:18.575
The key parts need to contrast ratio of at least three

88
00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:19.775
to one against the background.

89
00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:21.215
This just makes sure they don't

90
00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:22.375
fade away and become invisible.

91
00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:25.915
Ask yourself this, if a button doesn't have a solid color

92
00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:28.875
and its outline is the only thing that defines its shape,

93
00:03:29.305 --> 00:03:30.835
what happens when that outline is

94
00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.475
so faint it just blends into the page?

95
00:03:32.905 --> 00:03:34.475
Well, the button basically vanishes

96
00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:36.635
and you can't click what you can't see.

97
00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:37.915
That's why the contrast

98
00:03:37.915 --> 00:03:40.275
of these elements is every bit as important as the text.

99
00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:43.515
Now, there is one key exception to this rule.

100
00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:45.075
I should mention, if a button

101
00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:47.755
or a control is disabled, you know, grayed out,

102
00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:49.635
meaning you can't interact with it anyway.

103
00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:51.995
It doesn't have to meet these contrast rules.

104
00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:55.435
The focus is all about making sure the things people can

105
00:03:55.495 --> 00:03:56.715
use are clearly visible.

106
00:03:57.295 --> 00:03:59.755
And this brings us to our third and final rule,

107
00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:00.915
and it's a really big one.

108
00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:03.675
It's the idea that color, as powerful as it is,

109
00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:07.195
should never ever be the only way you're communicating an

110
00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:08.275
important piece of information.

111
00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:09.795
Color always needs a partner.

112
00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:12.585
The solution here is so simple and elegant.

113
00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:16.825
By all means, use color green for success, red for an error.

114
00:04:16.885 --> 00:04:18.265
That's intuitive, it's great,

115
00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.945
but the trick is to always pair that color

116
00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:23.585
with a second signal that doesn't rely on vision at all.

117
00:04:23.965 --> 00:04:26.065
So a green success message should also have

118
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.465
say a check mark icon.

119
00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:29.545
An error message needs more than just being red,

120
00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:32.095
and we've got a whole toolbox

121
00:04:32.095 --> 00:04:34.095
of these non-color signals to choose from.

122
00:04:34.705 --> 00:04:37.695
Icons are probably the most common simple text labels like

123
00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:39.535
error or required work perfectly

124
00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:42.335
and underline on a link, a pattern, fill on a chart,

125
00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:43.655
or even using a different shape.

126
00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.455
These can all do the job of reinforcing the message so

127
00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:48.815
that it gets through to absolutely everyone, no matter

128
00:04:48.835 --> 00:04:49.935
how they perceive color.

129
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.815
And this is where it gets super practical.

130
00:04:53.245 --> 00:04:54.535
Just picture a signup form

131
00:04:54.535 --> 00:04:57.055
where the required fields are only marked with red text.

132
00:04:57.435 --> 00:04:59.335
If you have a type of colorblindness where red

133
00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:00.735
and black look pretty much the same,

134
00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:03.295
that form is literally impossible to complete.

135
00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:04.415
You have no way of knowing

136
00:05:04.415 --> 00:05:05.775
what's required and what's optional.

137
00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:09.695
A simple asterisk right next to the red text problem solved.

138
00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:12.565
So after going through all that,

139
00:05:12.835 --> 00:05:15.525
what are the big ideas we should really walk away with?

140
00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:19.685
It all boils down to three simple foundational principles

141
00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:20.805
for designing with color.

142
00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:23.765
So let's just quickly recap the three key rules.

143
00:05:24.055 --> 00:05:27.565
First, make sure your text is readable with enough contrast.

144
00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.325
Second, make sure your buttons

145
00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:31.765
and controls are visible also with enough contrast.

146
00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:34.965
And third, never ever rely on color alone

147
00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:35.965
to get a message across.

148
00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:38.285
Always give it a helping hand with an icon

149
00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.805
or a label or an underline.

150
00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.755
And you know, these aren't just technical check boxes.

151
00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:43.915
You have to tick off a list.

152
00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:45.795
This is really a shift in mindset.

153
00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.875
Following these guidelines is an act of empathy.

154
00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:51.155
It's about recognizing that people experience the world

155
00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:53.275
differently and then making a conscious choice

156
00:05:53.335 --> 00:05:54.795
to include them in the digital

157
00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:56.835
spaces that we're all building. And

158
00:05:56.835 --> 00:05:58.205
That's really the amazing part.

159
00:05:58.355 --> 00:06:00.285
None of these rules are crazy complex.

160
00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:02.565
They're simple, thoughtful choices

161
00:06:02.955 --> 00:06:05.885
that when you make them consistently have this massive

162
00:06:06.445 --> 00:06:09.245
positive impact, they tear down those invisible barriers

163
00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:10.925
and help us build a digital world

164
00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:12.565
that is genuinely open to everyone.

165
00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:15.875
So I'll just leave you with this final thought to chew on.

166
00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:18.755
What would it feel like to browse a web where you never had

167
00:06:18.755 --> 00:06:20.435
to wonder if you were missing something important?

168
00:06:20.935 --> 00:06:23.715
How would our digital world actually change if every single

169
00:06:23.715 --> 00:06:26.235
piece of it was built for everyone right from the very

170
00:06:26.235 --> 00:06:26.515
beginning.

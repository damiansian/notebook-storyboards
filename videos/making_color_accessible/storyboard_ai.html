            Okay, so let's talk about something we see every single day. Color on our screens, the blues, the greens,
            the grays. They aren't just there to look pretty. They're fundamental language that helps us get around in
            our digital world, they guide our eyes, they signal what we can do.

            Now, it's really easy to think of this stuff as you know, an edge case, something that only affects a tiny
            number of people. But the truth is it's way more common than you'd think. The web Content Accessibility

            or WCAG, which is basically the global rule book for this, tells us that about 15% of working age adults
            have some kind of vision impairment. That's a huge number of people who might be struggling with designs
            that don't think about how color is perceived.

            how do we actually start breaking down these barriers? Well, the first and most fundamental rule is just
            about making sure people can read the words on the screen, and it all boils down to one simple concept.
            Contrast. Simply put, Contrast is just the difference in brightness between two colors next to each other.
